### **Ask**

**Business task:**

BB is a small company that has potential for global growth. They want to improve their marketing strategy by gaining insight into how consumers of non-BB products use their smart devices. Using this data, BB wants to compare and apply these insights to one of their products in order to obtain more information to improve their marketing strategy. Helping them unlock new growth potential.

**Key Stakeholders:**

- **Urška Sršen:** Bellabeat’s co founder and Chief Creative Officer
- **Sando Mur:** Mathematician and Bellabeat cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team
- Bellabeat executive team
- Bellabeat marketing team.

**Problem being solved?**

What are ways to improve marketing strategy to enable growth opportunities?

**How can your insights drive business decision making?**

We will be finding information as to how consumers of smart devices use their devices which will guide BB in ways to better their marketing strategy and improve their business and/or devices to help meet the needs and wants of the consumer.

### **Prepare**

**Where is your data stored?**

In Kaggle as a public domain with the dataset being made available by Mobius.

**How is the data organised? Is it in long or wide format?**

Wide (makes it easy to find and compare) and long (storing and organising data) format, but mostly wide.

**Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?**

The data contain information from 33 individuals which means the data is limited and so only a small sample of users can be portrayed through the data. This causes it not to be accurate to its true nature. However, the data was submitted by 33 respondents who agreed to have their data used. This data was collected in 2016 and so is not current as there have been large advances since then in smart devices.

These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016

The data was obtained from a third party, it is five years old and has only 33 respondents.

Hence, it is not reliable, original or current.

**How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?**

This data is under an open licence and so can be shared and used by anyone

**How did you verify the data’s integrity?**

By checking if it is ROCCC, I found that the data lacks validity and accuracy.

I also sorted and filtered the data to find any anomalies, N/A values, missing values and any data that was too high (an outlier) using conditional formatting.

**How does it help you answer your question?**

The data is only showing what the fitbit recorded, not necessarily how it was used. But through this, we can compare and contrast, between the fitbit and one of BellaBeat’s products, find USP’s that can differentiate BB from the rest of the market and thereafter use this as a marketing strategy to make BB standout from competitors.

We can find specific customer uses or needs, so if the users had lack of sleep, or had days that they didn’t exercise as much, or

**Are there any problems with the data?**

The data is limited, there are only 33 participants (even though the data sets have 33 id users) and so the data does not reflect the entire population.

Also the data is out of date, considering the fact that the data is needed for smart devices which is a market that has accelerated and boomed since 2016, the data would be considered too old. Also the data runs from 12/04/2016 - 12/05/2016, one month is not enough time to identify solid trends.

Additionally, Fitbit is a smart device that is targeted towards men and women whereas, Bellabeat is a product aimed towards women and tested only on women. This dataset reflects the use of the FitBit smartwatch but does not specify some key characteristics such as gender, age and height.

At this point, I prepared the data by ensuring there was a copy of the raw, uncleaned datasets. The data is organised in minutes, hours and days. I will merge together the days, the hours, and the weight and sleep into workbooks respectively. I will not be using the minutes data as it is not needed.

### **Process**

I will be processing the data in excel.

1. Ensure a copy is made of the raw, uncleaned data.
2. Freeze, highlight and bold the headers.
3. Expand columns if need be to view all the cells clearly.
4. Checking for and removing duplicates using ‘Remove Duplicates’ found in ‘Data Cleanup’.
5. Checked for whitespaces

**WeightLogInfo_merged**

1. Converted Date and Time format to DD/MM/YYYY and HH/MM/SS, the hours are shown as 24 so no need for PM or AM
2. Using LEN() we can see the id has the right amount of digits
3. Looking at this dataset, you can see that some have more logs than others. (see below)
4. I sorted the sheet by the range A-Z
5. WeightKG, BMI, WeightPounds to contain up to two decimal places
6. Imported SleepDay_merged into a new sheet within this workbook

**SleepDay_merged**

1. Changed the format of date and time to DD/MM/YYYY and HH/MM/SS.
2. Separated the date and time into two different columns.
3. Sorted sheet from range A-Z according to ID
4. Found three duplicate rows which were removed
5. Converted total hours asleep and total hours in bed into hours rather than minutes by creating a copied column and dividing the minutes by 60, then changed this to two decimal places.

**Hourly_calories_merged, Hourlyintensities_merged and Hourlysteps_merged**

1. Change the format of date and time to DD/MM/YYYY and HH/MM/SS and then Separate the time and date
2. Filter for any missing fields
3. Look for any nulls
4. Import hourlycalories_merged and hourlysteps_merged into new sheets within the same workbook

**DailySteps_merged, DailyIntensities_merged, DailyCalories_merged and DailyActivity_merged.**

1. The daily log entries were all checked to ensure they matched in terms of how many entries were made by each user id and also that there weren’t any more than 31. I used =COUNTIF() and =COUNTUNIQUE() to achieve this.
2. Froze the header, added a bold font, highlighted the header
3. Separated and changed the format of the date and time to DD/MM/YYYY and HH/MM/SS where need be
4. Filtered for missing values, dates or ID
5. Made all numbers to two decimal places for ease of reading
6. I imported all the daily data into one workbook within excel.

After processing the data, I decided to continue working with the data in sheets to better familiarise myself with it and try to identify anything to look out for and/or look further into.

- I used =COUNTUNIQUE() to identify how many Ids made logs for Weight, Sleep, the Hourly dataset and the Daily dataset. I found that the daily datasets had the most consistency with entries. After using =COUNTIF() I found 21 out of the 33 participants logged an entry everyday.
- Sleep logs were also not too bad with 24 Id entries and 12 participants logging their sleep over 20 days out of the 31 days.
- In the Hourly datasets, no one logged an entry every hour.
- And lastly, the weight logs were very poor. Only 8 logs out of 33 with only 2 participants logging over 20 times.
- I used =COUNT() to find how many steps were logged and then used =COUNTIF() to find how many daily steps were over 10,000, the CDC recommendation for an average person (seeing as we do not have any information about height or gender). I found that 303 participants had a step count of 10,000 out of the 940 logged.
- With the sleepday_merged, I checked the average sleep of each participant and used conditional formatting to highlight anything under 8 hours of sleep, the recommended amount. However, some participants logged every day whilst others only logged 2 to 3 days.

### Analyse - R

 I first installed all the packages that will be needed.

```r
install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)
install.packages('lubridate')
library(lubridate)
install.packages('dplyr')
library(dplyr)
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
install.packages("tidyr")
library(tidyr)
install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)
```

After looking through all the datasets, I decided to only work with a few to answer the question at hand. 

```r
daily_activity <- read.csv("/Users/christinaberhane/Desktop/R_files/ dailyActivity.csv", TRUE, ",")
```

I continued this to upload all datasets to R and then took a look at the data. 

```r
head(daily_activity)
colnames(daily_activity)
str(daily_activity)
```

I repeated this step for all datasets:

```r
daily_steps <- read.csv("/Users/christinaberhane/Desktop/R_files/ dailySteps.csv", TRUE, ",")
head(daily_steps)
colnames(daily_steps)
str(daily_steps)

daily_calories <- read.csv("/Users/christinaberhane/Desktop/R_files/dailyCalories.csv", TRUE, ",")
head(daily_calories)
colnames(daily_calories)
str(daily_calories)

daily_inten <- read.csv("/Users/christinaberhane/Desktop/R_files/dailyIntensities.csv", TRUE, ",")
head(daily_inten)
colnames(daily_inten)
str(daily_inten)

hourly_calories <- read.csv("/Users/christinaberhane/Desktop/R_files/hourlyCalories.csv", TRUE, ",")
head(hourly_calories)
colnames(hourly_calories)
str(hourly_calories)

hourly_inten <- read.csv("/Users/christinaberhane/Desktop/R_files/hourlyIntensities.csv", TRUE, ",")
head(hourly_inten)
colnames(hourly_inten)
str(hourly_inten)

hourly_steps <- read.csv("/Users/christinaberhane/Desktop/R_files/hourlySteps.csv", TRUE, ",")
head(hourly_steps)
colnames(hourly_steps)
str(hourly_steps)

sleep_day <- read.csv("/Users/christinaberhane/Desktop/R_files/sleepDay.csv", TRUE, ",")
head(sleep_day)
colnames(sleep_day)
str(sleep_day)

weight_log <- read.csv("/Users/christinaberhane/Desktop/R_files/weightLogInfo.csv", TRUE, ",")
head(weight_log)
colnames(weight_log)
str(weight_log)
```

```r
n_distinct(weight_log$Id)
```

weight_log only consists of 8 participants which is not enough to make an informed decision so I decided to leave this out. 

- d**aily_activity**
    
    ```r
    glimpse(daily_activity)
    ```
    
    ```r
    n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)
    ```
    
    After putting through this code, I was able to identify that this datasets has 33 number of participants. 
    
    ```r
    daily_activity %>%
    select(TotalSteps,
    TotalDistance,
    VeryActiveMinutes,
    FairlyActiveMinutes,
    LightlyActiveMinutes,
    SedentaryMinutes,
    Calories) %>%
    summary()
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-11-23 at 19.23.43.png](Bellabeat%20Case%20study%2056cf953afef84ae49854092c478bfccc/Screenshot_2023-11-23_at_19.23.43.png)
    
    According to [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/pdf/postcurriculum_session8.pdf), the recommended steps to walk per day is 10,000 as this has a lot of health benefits. Some of these benefits include better sleep and losing extra weight. The number of calories burnt does depend on your weight and the speed you walk but should be between 250 and 600 calories, the former being the recommended daily calories lost. 
    
    ```r
    ggplot(data=daily_activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories))
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-11-23 at 20.11.36.png](Bellabeat%20Case%20study%2056cf953afef84ae49854092c478bfccc/Screenshot_2023-11-23_at_20.11.36.png)
    
    From this, we can see the more steps taken the more calories lost. There is a positive relationship between steps walked and the calories lost. The majority of participants lost more that 600 calories but less had 10,000 steps or more. 
    
- s**leep_day**
    
    ```r
    glimpse(sleep_day)
    n_distinct(sleep_day)
    nrow(sleep_day)
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-11-23 at 20.29.03.png](Bellabeat%20Case%20study%2056cf953afef84ae49854092c478bfccc/Screenshot_2023-11-23_at_20.29.03.png)
    
    First, I would like to note there are not a lot of entries compared to other datasets.  
    
    ```r
    sleep_day %>%
    select(TotalMinutesAsleep,
    TotalAsleep.hours.,
    TotalTimeInBed) %>%
    summary()
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-12-03 at 17.12.08.png](Bellabeat%20Case%20study%2056cf953afef84ae49854092c478bfccc/Screenshot_2023-12-03_at_17.12.08.png)
    
    ```r
    ggplot(data=sleep_day, aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=TotalTimeInBed)) + geom_point()
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-12-01 at 14.49.34.png](Bellabeat%20Case%20study%2056cf953afef84ae49854092c478bfccc/Screenshot_2023-12-01_at_14.49.34.png)
    
    From this we are able to identify that participants are not sleeping enough. According to the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep/how-much-sleep#:~:text=Experts%20recommend%20that%20adults%20sleep%20between%207%20and%209%20hours%20a%20night), the recommended hours of sleep for adults if between 7 (420 minutes) and 9 (540 minutes) hours. However, according to the data, only a small cluster are sleeping between 7 and 9 hours. 
    
    Also, there were 31 nights where participants were spending more time in bed than they were sleeping. This data could point to signs of insomnia. [NHS Inform](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/mental-health/insomnia/#:~:text=Insomnia%20is%20difficulty%20getting%20to,it%20difficult%20to%20fall%20asleep) states that insomnia affects 1 in 3 people in the UK, this includes symptoms of struggling to fall asleep and lying in bed for long periods at night. One of the main causes of insomnia is stress and anxiety. 
    
    ```r
    mean (sleep_day$TotalMinutesAsleep)
    ```
    
    419 minutes is the average amount of minutes spent sleeping, equivalent to 7 hours, the minimum recommended amount. 
    
    ```r
    sleep_day %>%
    select(TotalSleepRecords) %>%
    summary()
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-12-03 at 17.17.36.png](Bellabeat%20Case%20study%2056cf953afef84ae49854092c478bfccc/Screenshot_2023-12-03_at_17.17.36.png)
    
    However, we can establish from the TotalSleepRecords that there is not enough data to be able to establish a good enough understanding to lead to a informed conclusion.  
    
- **weight**
    
    ```r
    weight_log %>%
    select(WeightKg,
    BMI) %>%
    summary()
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-12-03 at 17.26.37.png](Bellabeat%20Case%20study%2056cf953afef84ae49854092c478bfccc/Screenshot_2023-12-03_at_17.26.37.png)
    
    Do not have gender, and height which both contribute to weight. In 2021, the mean weights of men and women based on adjustments to self-reported weight were **85.1kg** and 71.8kg, respectively, this is according to [NHS](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2021/part-4-trends#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20mean%20weights,to%2072.1kg%20among%20women). However, this data set is limited as we are unable to draw key characteristics to the weight mentioned and so cannot make a well-informed decision due to this. 
    
- s**leep_day vs daily_activity**
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-12-03 at 18.09.07.png](Bellabeat%20Case%20study%2056cf953afef84ae49854092c478bfccc/Screenshot_2023-12-03_at_18.09.07.png)
    
    I merged the two datasets together (sleep_day and daily_activity) by Id to be able to understand if there is any correlation between the total amount of steps and time asleep. 
    
    ```r
    ggplot(data=combined_outer) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=TotalAsleep.hours., y=TotalSteps))
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-12-03 at 18.33.10.png](Bellabeat%20Case%20study%2056cf953afef84ae49854092c478bfccc/Screenshot_2023-12-03_at_18.33.10.png)
    
    We can identify from this line graph that between 9,000 and 10,000 steps, participants only slept between 4.5 and 5.5 hours. Surprisingly, those who had approximately 8,00 steps or less, slept more that those with between 9,000 and 10,000 steps. 
    
- **daily_steps vs daily_calories**
    
    ```r
    ggplot(data=steps_calories_outer, aes(x=Calories, y=StepTotal)) + geom_smooth()
    ```
    
    ![Screenshot 2023-12-03 at 22.49.33.png](Bellabeat%20Case%20study%2056cf953afef84ae49854092c478bfccc/Screenshot_2023-12-03_at_22.49.33.png)
    
    From this, we are able to establish that those who had a total steps of 8,000 - 10,000 showed consistent weight loss.  However, there is no relationship between  daily steps and calories. A potential reason for the drop in calories even though there is an increase in steps could be due to the pace. [Prevention](https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a41048373/calories-burned-walking/#) indicates “Increasing the intensity of your workout results in an elevated heart rate, which requires more energy and results in more calories burned,”. Thus, the pace could be the reason as to why there is no consistent relationship.

### **Act**

1. BellaBeat should adjust their marketing strategy to include the fact that their smartwatch is able to track stress. From the analysis above, I was able to identify most participants were not sleeping enough, the most likely reason for this could be insomnia which is caused by stress.

1 in 4 women suffer with insomnia compared to 1 in 5 men, Bellabeat is a product targeted for women and so this would speak to their target market. 

1. To continue on from point 1, BellaBeat can also include a system that notifies wearers when it is time for sleep. Participants spent a lot of time in bed with not sleep, this can be due to insomnia or phone use. with a notification, wearers will be alerted when it is time to put their phone away and sleep. 
2. The CDC recommends the average person should walk 10,000 steps per day, however, participants’ average was 7,500. BellaBeat should include the fact that they track steps in their marketing strategy and portray the fact that with the help of one of BellaBeats devices, a user can achieve 10,000 steps. This in return can help reduce the risk of disease, stroke, cancer and heart failure according to Nuffield Health. 
3. Lastly, the data suggests that the more active an individual is the more calories they will burn. Therefore, BellaBeat could look into marketing the fact that it tracks how much time an individual spends very active, active and sedentary. Bellabeat could also convey the fact that if the users’ device is connected to their Apple health or Google fit, they can access a live feed of their activity, steps and calories lost to help achieve their goals.
